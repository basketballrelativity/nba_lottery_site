Site to host live NBA Draft Lottery Odds

## Purpose

While many sites are dedicated to the NBA Draft Lottery (like the great [Tankathon](http://www.tankathon.com/)), they fall short of providing live odds for each team during the lottery. When a team is revealed, this information can be used to update the odds of receiving each pick for each team. What does it mean when a team is "skipped", and how does it impact your team's odds at receiving the top pick? This tool is meant to serve these types of questions (especially during the interminable commercial break before the order of the top picks are revealed).
